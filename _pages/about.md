# About me 👋

Hi there, I'm Jungang (Gordon) Chen 🐳  

I'm currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [Bureau of Economic Geology](https://www.beg.utexas.edu/), Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin.  

My current duties include:  
1. **Leading the development of [EASiTool](https://www.beg.utexas.edu/research/programs/carbon-utilization-storage/tools/easitool)** – a Python-based CO₂ storage capacity estimation platform that is trusted and used by **over 100 professionals** from industry, government, and academia.  
2. **Employing and developing machine learning algorithms** to improve the description, prediction, and control of subsurface systems, with a particular focus on **carbon capture and storage (CCS)**.

## My research interests include:

- Multi-agent reinforcement learning and game-theoretic approaches for CO₂ storage optimization  
- Uncertainty quantification of subsurface systems under safety and regulatory constraints  
- Integration of geoscience domain knowledge with AI/ML to advance sustainable energy solutions  
- Development of reproducible, open-source tools for reservoir modeling and CO₂ storage assessment
