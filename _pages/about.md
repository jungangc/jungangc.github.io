Hi there, I'm Jungang (Gordon) Chen 🐳  

I'm currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [Bureau of Economic Geology](https://www.beg.utexas.edu/), Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin.  

My current duties include:  
1. **Leading the development of newest version of [EASiTool](https://gccc.beg.utexas.edu/easitool)** – a Python-based CO₂ storage capacity estimation platform that is trusted and used by **>100 professionals** from industry, government, and academia.  
2. **Employing and developing machine learning algorithms** to improve the description, prediction, and control of subsurface systems, with a particular focus on **carbon capture and storage (CCS)**.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Petroleum Engineering in 2024 from **Texas A&M University**, where my research focused on numerical simulation, scientific machine learning, deep learning-based surrogate modeling, and reinforcement learning applications.  
Outside of work, I'm also interested in exploring **LLM applications**, and I enjoy activities like **playing tennis 🎾**.

## My research interests include:

- CCS, computational geoenergy, machine learning
- Integration of domain knowledge with AI/ML to advance sustainable energy solutions  
- Development of reproducible, open-source tools for reservoir modeling and CO₂ storage assessment
